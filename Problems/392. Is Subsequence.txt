-- Problem Name: "392. Is Subsequence" (https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)
-- Difficulty: Easy
-- Language: C++
-- Problem statement (condensed):
Given a string "s" and a string "text". Return true if s is a subsequence of text.

-- Logic/Explanation: 
We use 2 pointers, 1 pointing to s called "p2" and 1 to text called "p1". Then we increment p1 throughout 
the entirety of text string and increment the pointer p2 if text[p1] matches s[p2]. 

Then, if the final value of p2 is equal to the size of "s", then that means s was indeed a subsequence of 
text.

Things to note: 

-- Time complexity: O(n)
-- Code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int p2 = 0;
        for (int p1 = 0; p1 < t.size(); p1++) {
            if (t[p1] == s[p2])
                p2++;
        }
        
        return p2 == s.size() ? true : false;
    }
};
